Description: Routing daemon for the eigrp protocol
 The routing daemon was build to resemble the original eigrp configuration and
 workflow of a Cisco router. It uses the Ciscos eigrp protocol and can
 communicate with Cisco routers. Setting it up is easy if you know how to
 configure a cisco router as all the commands are similar. It uses a conf file
 as a startup-config from which it loads the configuration. While the daemon
 is running it will search for neighbors at the configured interfaces and add
 or remove routes from the routing table.
